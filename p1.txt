Forwarding explanation:


cycle 4/5:
In cycle 4/5, the add instruction has two RAWs from the two lbi instructions. It will use RF bypassing (cycle 4) for RS by writing before reading and ex-ex forwarding for RT (cycle 5)

ex- ex forwarding reasoning
Ex/mem.reg RD == Id/Ex.reg RT & Ex/Mem Regwrite == 1 

Rf bypassing
Id.reg Rs == Wb.reg Rd & Ex.reg Rd != Id.reg Rs & Mem.reg Rd != Id.reg Rs

cycle 6:
In cycle 6, the sub instruction has a RAW from the add instruction above it. It will need ex-ex forwarding to not stall 
Ex/mem.reg RD == Id/Ex.reg RS & Ex/Mem Regwrite == 1 

Cycle 9:
In cylce 9, the rol instruction has a RAW from the lbi instruction above it for RT. It will need to use RF bypassing and write before it reads.
Id.reg Rt == Wb.reg Rd & Ex.reg Rd != Id.reg Rt & Mem.reg Rd != Id.reg Rs

Forwarding explanation:
Cycle 5:
In cycle 5, the add instruction has a RAW data hazard with the lbi instruction. It will use mem-ex forwarding on r0(RS)because of the nop instruction imbetween the two instructions. 
Mem/Wb.reg Rd == Id/Ex.reg Rs & Mem/Wb RegWrite == 1 & Ex/mem.reg Rd != Id/Ex.reg Rs 


Cycle 8:
In cycle 8, the add instruction has a RAW data hazard with the load instruction. It will use mem-ex forwarding on r3(RT) because r3 is not ready until after memory because it is a load
Mem/Wb.reg Rd == Id/Ex.reg Rt & Mem/Wb RegWrite == 1 & Mem/wb RegRd != 0 (not sure about last part again)

Stalling Explanation:
Cycle 6:
The add instruction stalls on cycle 6 because it needs to wait to enter execute unitl after the ld instruction finishes the memory stage and has the value ready to be forwarded
If/Id.reg Rt == Id/Ex.reg Rd & Id/Ex.Memread = 1 & Id/Ex.RegWrite = 1
